# Beginning Python

*outline / notes page for delivery of intro / admin. topics to be covered*

## Welcome

### Introductions
* Whoami
* Who are you.
   * Name
   * How are you going to use Python in your work... Ideally next week.
   * Are their specific things you are hoping to learn

### Why Python
* Easiest / Cleanest / Fastest language to develop with
* Mature, **tons of docs**, tons of third party contributions
* Continues to Grow...
* ... More people using... more help that is available.

**Programming language Growth**

### Python is small
* The total number of [reserved words](https://docs.python.org/3.3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#keywords) that make up the language: **33**
```
False      class      finally    is         return
None       continue   for        lambda     try
True       def        from       nonlocal   while
and        del        global     not        with
as         elif       if         or         yield
assert     else       import     pass
break      except     in         raise
```

*Python execution speed is slow, however relative development time is fast*

### Who is using python:
* **Everyone!**
* dropbox
* youtube 
* instagram: a django web app 
* Netflix
* Spotify

### Review Pre-requisites
Everyone has the following installed:
* python 3
* git
* vscode
* vscode python extension
* some kind of useful text editor (ideally notepad++)

## Teaching Objectives

* **Lower the barrier to getting started with Python.**
* Provide an overview / intro to the core python language
* Provide an overview / intro to some basic programming tools
   * **virtualenv / pip:** managing dependencies
   * **git:** source code / version management
   * **VSCode:** Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
* Identify additional topics to pursue beyond those covered in this training.
* Get you started with how to interact with web services using python

* Course is designed to you started.
    * Revisit the docs at [python.org](https://docs.python.org/3/) regularly as your skills grow
    * [python.org tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html) is a good place to come back to on a regular basis.

## Training Format
* departure from standard lecture / lab format
* A *LOT* of material to be covered.
* Trying out new approach / small lesson / small group exercise
* The course will cover more material in less depth
* Much of the course will use Jupyter notebooks
* Hoping the notebooks can serve as a place where you can add your notes, and include code examples.
